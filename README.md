Simple Spotify Playlist Server

Here Im trying implementing Clean Code Architecture and Dependency Injection. However, I still suck at it so here we are.

Features:
- Get all songs (opt query param -> sort: "asc"/"desc"/"")
- Get song by id
- Add song
- Play song

ps:
The index file is basically in src and called app.js. Also for sorting I implemented bubble sort algorithm to sort the playlist in both descending and ascending way. Please if you have any feedback, don't mind to give one cause I would like to get a feedback about this terrible repo T_T
